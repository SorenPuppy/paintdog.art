# Hey there! 

## My name's Soren! I'm a big ol' word sayer and I'll gladly talk your ear off about just anything if given the chance to. Here's some general info about me!

- My pronouns are it/they/puppy! **If your language does not allow for gender neutral pronouns, masculine pronouns are ok!** 

- 24 Years Old (6/6 for anyone who likes to keep track)

- I'm from Puerto Rico, and am fluent in both English and Spanish.

- I love playing games, writing, music, anime, movies, books... I just love some good media in all formats. I also draw, though not as often as I'd like to.

- I'm happily taken by the one and only [Dannie Cat](https://me.dannie.cat)!

- This blog may contain content considered mature in nature. Post will be tagged with the "18+" category if applicable. By accessing these post, you certify that you are at least 18 years of age.
